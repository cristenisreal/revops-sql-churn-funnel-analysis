# Inbound Lead Growth Experiment (A/B Test)

## Objective
Measure whether a new inbound acquisition strategy (e.g. landing page or lead magnet) increases inbound leads by **75%** compared to baseline.

## Experiment Design
- Control (A): Existing inbound flow
- Treatment (B): New inbound flow
- Equal traffic split
- Measured on lead volume, conversion rate, and qualified leads

## Metrics Tracked
- Inbound leads
- Lead conversion rate (leads / sessions)
- Qualified lead rate (MQLs)
- Lift % vs control

## SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Relational modeling
- A/B experiment analysis
- Funnel conversion metrics
- KPI validation against targets

## Files
- `schema.sql` – experiment tables
- `seed.sql` – simulated experiment data
- `queries.sql` – lift and performance analysis

## Outcome
This analysis validates whether the treatment variant meets or exceeds a **+75% lead growth target**, enabling data-driven go/no-go decisions.
